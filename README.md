- 👋 Hi, I’m @Data-Mirlin
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linear regression as part of my data science certification. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that are not too hard since I am a newbie. Before all the automation and from many years ago, I created a linear regression model to predict a glass furnace bunker oil consumption vs furnace temperature. I also did a regression model on a compressor manufacturing plant which predicted that every time the factory doubled the aggregate production then the plant productivity increased by 11%.  
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure yet what the options are for contacts.
